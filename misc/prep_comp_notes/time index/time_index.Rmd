```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = F, warning = F)
```

```{r, echo = F}

df1 <- data.frame(
  'id' = c(letters[1:3], letters[1:3], letters[1:3]),
  'score' = c(rnorm(9, 20, 4)),
  'time' = c(seq(from = 1, to = 3, each = 3)))


df2 <- data.frame(
  'id' = c(rep('a', 3), rep('b', 3), rep('c', 3)),
  'score' = c(rnorm(9, 20, 4)),
  'time' = c(rep(c(1:3), each = 3))
)

```

There are two code variations I use to generate time indexes. If I need time cycles

```{r, echo = F}

df1

```

then I use a sequence command.

```{r, eval = F}

time <- seq(from = 1, to = 3, each = 3)
```

If I need time ordered

```{r, echo = F}

df2
```

then I use a replicate command.

```{r}
time <- rep(c(1:3), each = 3)
```
