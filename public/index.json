In all of the other examples I estimated the variance (1 parameter) and the mean (1 parameter) of the latent exogenous variable. In this case, unobserved heterogeneity is the latent exogenous variable but I only estimated its variance. That’s because in this model we don’t really care about the mean of unobserved heterogeneity, it’s just a latent variable that we incorporate to account for stable individual differences. In other words, when I estimate latent cog ability and assertiveness as IVs to predict an outcome, I care about their means. Here, unobserved heterogeneity is just an additional factor to account for, not a variable whose mean I really care to know. That said, if I wanted to estimate the mean of unobserved heterogeneity (which would result in one additional estimated parameter and one fewer df) then I would incorporate the following into the model string.\n\u0026#39; unob_het ~ 1 # lavaan code for estimating the mean of a latent variable \u0026#39; Bo\\(^2\\)m =)\n   ","date":1590537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590537600,"objectID":"c180065b5f9cf871266435dd1639d167","permalink":"https://christopherdishop.netlify.app/comp-notes/2017-07-13-dfs/","publishdate":"2020-05-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/comp-notes/2017-07-13-dfs/","section":"comp-notes","summary":"This post contains a bunch of examples where I practice counting dfs.","tags":null,"title":"Counting Degrees of Freedom","type":"comp-notes"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6087c0ef875554f4409ac52928d79279","permalink":"https://christopherdishop.netlify.app/projects/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/","section":"","summary":"See some of the projects I have worked on","tags":null,"title":"Projects","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://christopherdishop.netlify.app/about/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"A little more about me and how to get in touch","tags":null,"title":"Resume","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"3960dd3bdc6f629fb800d1d2aaa7224f","permalink":"https://christopherdishop.netlify.app/resume/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resume/","section":"","summary":"A little more about me and how to get in touch","tags":null,"title":"Resume","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"65de3680a280f6bf29dc34fe1adad5a6","permalink":"https://christopherdishop.netlify.app/talks/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talks/","section":"","summary":"Upcoming and recent talks / workshops","tags":null,"title":"Talks \u0026 Workshops","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My blog posts are released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n   ","date":1530140400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530140400,"objectID":"53e892b8b41cc4caece1cfd5ef21d6e7","permalink":"https://christopherdishop.netlify.app/license/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/license/","section":"","summary":"My blog posts are released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.","tags":null,"title":"LICENSE: CC-BY-SA","type":"page"},{"authors":["Eric Feczko","Nadir Balba","Oscar Miranda-Dominguez","Michaela Cordova","Sarah Karalunas","Lourdes Irwin","Damion Demeter","","Beth Hoover Langhorst","Julia Grieser Painter","Jan van Santen","Eric Fombonne","Joel Nigg","Damien Fair"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1513728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513728000,"objectID":"dbc47f036e165ec68800b8c89a360f76","permalink":"https://christopherdishop.netlify.app/publication/2017-subtyping/","publishdate":"2017-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-subtyping/","section":"publication","summary":"DSM-5 Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) comprises a set of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive behaviors or restricted interests, and may both affect and be affected by multiple cognitive mechanisms. This study attempts to identify and characterize cognitive subtypes within the ASD population using a random forest (RF) machine learning classification model. We trained our model on measures from seven tasks that reflect multiple levels of information processing. 47 ASD diagnosed and 58 typically developing (TD) children between the ages of 9 and 13 participated in this study. Our RF model was 72.7% accurate, with 80.7% specificity and 63.1% sensitivity. Using the RF model, we measured the proximity of each subject to every other subject, generating a distance matrix between participants. This matrix was then used in a community detection algorithm to identify subgroups within the ASD and TD groups, revealing 3 ASD and 4 TD putative subgroups with unique behavioral profiles. We then examined differences in functional brain systems between diagnostic groups and putative subgroups using resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rsfcMRI).

Speech disfluencies may serve pragmatic functions such as cueing speaking problems. Previous studies have found that speakers with ASD differ from typically developing (TD) speakers in the types and patterns of disfluencies they produce, but fail to provide sufficiently detailed characterizations of the methods used to categorize and quantify disfluency, making cross-study comparison difficult. In this study we propose a simple schema for classifying major disfluency types, and use this schema in an exploratory analysis of differences in disfluency rates and patterns among children with ASD compared to TD and language impaired (SLI) groups. 115 children ages 4–8 participated in the study (ASD = 51; SLI = 20; TD = 44), completing a battery of experimental tasks and assessments. Measures of morphological and syntactic complexity, as well as word and disfluency counts, were derived from transcripts of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). High inter-annotator agreement was obtained with the use of the proposed schema. Analyses showed ASD children produced a higher ratio of content to filler disfluencies than TD children. Relative frequencies of repetitions, revisions, and false starts did not differ significantly between groups. TD children also produced more cued disfluencies than ASD children.","tags":null,"title":"Quantitative Analysis of Disfluency in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder or Language Impairment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","Katharine Zuckerman","Eric Fombonne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1455840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1455840000,"objectID":"0b6a054d394b57b2726a4664b37d577a","permalink":"https://christopherdishop.netlify.app/publication/2016-primer-on-asd/","publishdate":"2016-02-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-primer-on-asd/","section":"publication","summary":"In this chapter, we review existing prevalence estimates for ASDs since 2000 and discuss methodological factors impacting the estimation of prevalence and the interpretation of changes in prevalence estimates over time.

Children with specific language impairment (SLI) display similar impairments in language. Given evidence for phenotypic and possibly etiologic overlap between SLI and ASD, it has been suggested that language-impaired children with ASD (ASD + language impairment, ALI) may be characterized as having both ASD and SLI. However, the extent to which the language phenotypes in SLI and ALI can be viewed as similar or different depends in part upon the age of the individuals studied. The purpose of the current study is to examine differences in memory abilities, specifically those that are key “markers” of heritable SLI, among young school-age children with SLI, ALI, and ALN (ASD + language normal). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, three groups of children between ages 5 and 8 years participated: SLI (n = 18), ALI (n = 22), and ALN (n = 20). A battery of cognitive, language, and ASD assessments was administered as well as a nonword repetition (NWR) test and measures of verbal memory, visual memory, and processing speed. Results: NWR difficulties were more severe in SLI than in ALI, with the largest effect sizes in response to nonwords with the shortest syllable lengths. Among children with ASD, NWR difficulties were not associated with the presence of impairments in multiple ASD domains, as reported previously. Verbal memory difficulties were present in both SLI and ALI groups relative to children with ALN. Performance on measures related to verbal but not visual memory or processing speed were significantly associated with the relative degree of language impairment in children with ASD, supporting the role of verbal memory difficulties in language impairments among early school-age children with ASD. Conclusions: The primary difference between children with SLI and ALI was in NWR performance, particularly in repeating two- and three-syllable nonwords, suggesting that shared difficulties in early language learning found in previous studies do not necessarily reflect the same underlying mechanisms.","tags":null,"title":"Memory in language-impaired children with and without autism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","Katharine Zuckerman","Eric Fombonne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1433894400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1433894400,"objectID":"a74fffb3b5bb1b85c72e901b096bac30","permalink":"https://christopherdishop.netlify.app/publication/2015-translational/","publishdate":"2015-06-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-translational/","section":"publication","summary":"In this chapter, we review existing prevalence estimates for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) since 2000 and discuss methodological factors impacting the estimation of prevalence and the interpretation of changes in prevalence estimates over time.

We also investigated whether children with ABP experience more intensive medical interventions, greater impairments in behavioral functioning, and more severe comorbid problems than children with ASD who do not have ABP. One in four children with ASD had Child Behavior Checklist scores on the Aggressive Behavior scale in the clinical range (T-scores = 70). Sociodemographic factors (age, gender, parent education, race, ethnicity) were unrelated to ABP status. The presence of ABP was significantly associated with increased use of psychotropic drugs and melatonin, lower cognitive functioning, lower ASD severity, and greater comorbid sleep, internalizing, and attention problems. In multivariate models, sleep, internalizing, and attention problems were most strongly associated with ABP.

The results indicate robust differences in echolalia between the TD and ASD groups as a whole (ALN + ALI), and between TD and ALN children. There were no significant differences between ALI and SLI children for echolalia or self-repetitions. The results confirm previous findings that children with ASD repeat the language of others more than other populations of children. On the other hand, self-repetition does not appear to be significantly more frequent in ASD, nor does it matter whether the child’s echolalia occurred within one (immediate) or two turns (near-immediate) of the adult’s original utterance. Furthermore, non-significant differences between ALN and SLI, between TD and SLI, and between ALI and TD are suggestive that echolalia may not be specific to ALN or to ASD in general. One important innovation of this work is an objective fully automatic technique for assessing the amount of repetition in a transcript of a child’s utterances.","tags":null,"title":"Quantifying Repetitive Speech in Autism Spectrum Disorders and Language Impairment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kristina M.

However, research has generally overlooked children’s feelings and perceptions about gender-related interpersonal interactions. This paper investigates the nature of children’s attitudes about same- and other-gender peers, and explores how those attitudes relate to the expectancies and beliefs children hold about same- and other-gender peer interactions. Children (N = 98 fifth graders) completed questionnaires assessing their global liking of own- and other-gender peers (Yee \u0026 Brown, 1994), positive and negative attitudes about own- and other-gender peers, and outcome expectancies related to interacting with own- and other-gender peers. Results indicated that rather than being characterized by out-group negativity, children’s inter-group gender attitudes are best characterized by an in-group positivity bias. Children’s positive and negative affective attitudes were also significantly associated with outcome expectancies. In contrast, global liking of own- and other- gender peers was less predictive of outcome expectancies. Thus, the greater specificity of the affective attitude measures appeared to be a more predictive and potentially fruitful gauge of children’s feelings about own- and other-gender peers. Results are discussed in terms of the need for finer grained and more extensive studies of children’s gender-related feelings and cognitions about own- and other-gender peers.","tags":null,"title":"‘It’s Not That We Hate You’: Understanding Children’s Gender Attitudes and Expectancies About Peer Relationships","type":"publication"},{"authors":["","Tedra A.

Type of encoding (item-specific or relational) was manipulated between subjects in Experiment 1 and within subjects in Experiment 2. Decision-based explanations (e.g., the distinctiveness heuristic) predict reductions in false recognition in between-subjects designs, but not in within-subjects designs, because they are conceptualized as global shifts in decision criteria. Memory-based explanations predict reductions in false recognition in both designs, resulting from enhanced recollection of item-specific details. False recognition was reduced following item-specific encoding instructions in both experiments, favoring a memory-based explanation. These results suggest that providing unique cues for the retrieval of individual studied items results in enhanced discrimination between those studied items and critical lures. Conversely, enhancing the similarity of studied items results in poor discrimination among items within a particular list theme.
