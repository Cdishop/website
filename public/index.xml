      <description>Clipboard.js in hugo clipboard.js lets you easily copy text to the clipboard. With no need for Flash, it&amp;rsquo;s a great lightweight way to allow your visitors to copy code snippets on your site.
It&amp;rsquo;s a perfectly combination with a syntax highlighting library like rainbows or highlightjs.
In this short tuto i implemented clipboard.js in my template bulma for hugo.
Installation for hugo project Get the package from a third-party CDN provider and place the clipboard.</description>

      <title>Prototyping with markdown</title>

      <description>I have been working on a large set of documentation for a prototype that will eventually make it into a product. One issue with the publishing system at my company is that it makes doing prototypes, or really anything not within the rigidly and narrowly scoped model, difficult to set up. It takes a lot of work just to get to the point where you can begin writing.
Since time was of the essence and writing is expensive, I decided to do the prototype outside of the publishing system.</description>

      <title>Password Protection with PassKeeper</title>
      <link>/project/2008-12-30-password-protection-with-passkeeper/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After recently losing a USB flash drive with all my passwords on it, I was grateful for the precaution I took by storing my password data encrypted using Brad Greenlee’s PassKeeper password manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&#34;PassKeeper&#34; href=&#34;http://www.passkeeper.com/&#34;&gt;PassKeeper&lt;/a&gt; is a Windows utility that allows you to keep a list of accounts with usernames, passwords, and notes. This list is stored encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The utility is freeware and has been available for public download since the mid-90’s. Data are encrypted using the 56-bit &lt;a title=&#34;DES cipher&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;DES&lt;/a&gt; cipher and stored in an DAT file in the application’s root directory. The size of the application (189 kilobytes) and the data file (~400 bytes/entry) are lightweight and can easily be carried around on any USB flash drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 2016-11-22&lt;/strong&gt;: In 2010 I switched to KeePass, which &lt;a href=&#34;/managing-passwords-across-devices/&#34;&gt;works across devices&lt;/a&gt; and provides features such as secure password generation and grouping.
