<p>A couple quick pieces of code to assist any time I need to work with many CSV files.</p>
<div id="into-list" class="section level1">
<h1>Into List</h1>
<p>This first code chunk loads all of the CSV files in a folder, makes each into data frame, and stores each separately in a list.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setwd(&quot;enter path&quot;)

# A character vector of every file name

files &lt;- Sys.glob(&quot;*.csv&quot;)

# A list of all CSV files in the respective folder as data.frames

myfiles &lt;- lapply(files, FUN = read.csv)

# To load any single data set...

data_set1 &lt;- myfiles[[1]]</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="into-single-data-frame" class="section level1">
<h1>Into Single Data Frame</h1>
<p>The code above stores each file into a list as a separate data frame. If I want to combine every CSV file into the same data frame I can do the following:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>setwd(&quot;enter path&quot;)

# A character vector of every file name

files &lt;- list.files(pattern = &quot;*.csv&quot;)

# Now the full command

data_set &lt;- do.call(cbind, 
                    lapply(files, 
                           function(x) read.csv(x, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)))</code></pre>
<p>The code shown uses “cbind” so every variable within every CSV file will receive its own column in my “data_set.” If every CSV file has the same variable names replace “cbind” with “rbind.”</p>

</div>
