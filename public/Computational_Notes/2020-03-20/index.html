<h1>Example 3 - Scrape My Website</h1>
<p>What if I want to scrape the computational notes on my own website? I need a for-loop to iterate over each page, and I’d like to end up with a data set containing the following for each page:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>title</p></li>
<li><p>the text content.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My website gets tripped up when it tries to scrape itself while rendering. So, I’ll post this example on github. Here is the <a href="https://cdishop.github.io/Cdishop.github.io.own_scrape/">link</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="example-4---scrape-imdb" class="section level1">
<h1>Example 4 - Scrape IMDB</h1>
<p>In the prior examples, I scraped text. What if I want to scrape a movie rating from IMDB?</p>
<pre class="r"><code># scrape the score for &#39;there will be blood&#39;
movie_page &lt;- read_html(&quot;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot;)
review &lt;- html_nodes(movie_page, &quot;strong span&quot;) %&gt;%
          html_text() %&gt;%
          as.numeric()

<pre><code>## [1] 8.2</code></pre>
<p>It would be great if I could create a vector of movie titles and then enter a command to impute a single title into the “search” menu on IMDB, but doing so is not straight forward in <code>R</code>. <code>RSelenium</code> is an option but I wasn’t able to figure it out. Here’s a <a href="http://zevross.com/blog/2015/05/19/scrape-website-data-with-the-new-r-package-rvest/">link that uses it</a>.</p>
