<p>Here is a quick piece of code to create numeric response scores when data are read in as strings (e.g., “Strongly Agree, Agree, Neutral”).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(plyr)

df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;path&quot;)

labels_to_values1 &lt;- function(x){
  
  mapvalues(x, from = c(&quot;Strongly Agree&quot;, 
                        &quot;Agree&quot;, 
                        &quot;Slightly Agree&quot;, 
                        &quot;Slightly Disagree&quot;, 
                        &quot;Disagree&quot;, 
                        &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot;),
                        to = c(6,5,4,3,2,1))
  
}

recode_df &lt;- df %&gt;%
  select(column_to_modify1, column_to_modify2, column_to_modify2, etc) %&gt;%
  apply(2, FUN = labels_to_values1) %&gt;%
  data.frame()</code></pre>
<p>Note that R will throw you warnings if all of the response options are not used, but the code will still work.</p>
